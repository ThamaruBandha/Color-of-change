          <h2>Why I Created This</h2>

          <p>
            I am an 18-year-old student, and I created this site because racial 
            injustice is not a headline; it is a lived reality. It is felt 
            quietly in classrooms where some students are judged before they
            speak, in workplaces where talent is questioned because of appearance, 
            and in daily interactions where skin color becomes a label instead of a trait.
          </p>

          <p>
            There’s a saying we grow up hearing:
            <strong>“Gorey mukhde pe kala chashma.”</strong>
            But the real question is —
            <strong>what if the mukhda itself is kala?</strong>
            Does that make someone any less worthy of respect, safety, or
            opportunity? Of course not.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can wear a kala chashma. You can wear anything you like.
            What truly needs upgrading is not appearance, but thinking.
            A mature society does not judge people by race, shade, or origin.
            It judges them by humanity, character, and actions.
          </p>

          <p>
            This website exists to challenge normalized bias, to replace
            ignorance with awareness, and to remind people that racism,
            whether loud or subtle, has consequences. It costs lives, dreams,
            confidence, and futures. And when we stay silent, we become part of
            the system that allows it to continue.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is not about blame. It is about responsibility.
            Responsibility to listen. To learn. To understand.
            And most importantly, to act.
          </p>

          <p class="hook">
            Change doesn’t begin when everyone agrees.
            It begins when someone decides injustice is no longer acceptable.
          </p>
          <p> Please take this site as a reminder that every human life has value and deserves
            to be treated with dignity, irrespective of race, color, or background.</p>
