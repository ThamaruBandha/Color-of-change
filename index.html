        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h3>Racism Is Not Just History</h3>
          <p>
            Racial injustice is not something that ended decades ago. It exists
            today in classrooms, workplaces, hospitals, neighborhoods, and
            justice systems. For many Black individuals, discrimination is not
            an exception; it is a repeated experience that shapes how they move
            through the world.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h3>The Human Cost of Discrimination</h3>
          <p>
            Being judged by skin color affects mental health, confidence, and
            self-worth. Studies show that repeated exposure to racism increases
            stress, anxiety, depression, and feelings of isolation. In extreme
            cases, it can push people toward self-harm; not because
            they are weak, but because they are tired of being treated as less
            than human.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h3>From Childhood to Adulthood</h3>
          <p>
            Racism does not wait for adulthood. Black children are disciplined
            more harshly in schools and denied opportunities early in life. 
            As adults, these patterns continue through hiring bias, wage gaps,
            housing discrimination, and unequal treatment even today.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h3>Loss of Opportunity</h3>
          <p>
            Black students and professionals are often overlooked, not because
            they lack talent, intelligence, or ambition, but because of bias.
            When someone is denied education, jobs, or safety because of race,
            society loses potential leaders, innovators, and voices that could
            change the world.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h3>What the Data Shows</h3>
          <p>
            Research from organizations like the NAACP, Pew Research Center, and
            the CDC shows consistent racial disparities in policing, healthcare,
            education, and income. Black people are more likely to face police
            violence, less likely to receive quality medical care, and more
            likely to live in under-resourced communities.
          </p>
          </div>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h3>This Is a Global Issue</h3>
          <p>
            Racism is not limited to one country. Across the world, in both
            predominantly Black and non-Black nations, people face
            discrimination based on skin tone, ethnicity, or background.
            Silence allows this harm to continue. Awareness is the first step
            toward accountability.
