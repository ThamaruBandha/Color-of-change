          Change does not happen by accident. It happens when people choose to
          speak, act, and stand up even when it’s uncomfortable.

        <h2>Why Taking Action Matters</h2>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h3>Silence Protects Injustice</h3>
          <p>
            When discrimination goes unchallenged, it becomes normalized.
            Speaking up, even in small ways, disrupts systems that rely on
            silence to survive.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h3>Your Voice Has Power</h3>
          <p>
            Writing messages, sharing information, and demanding accountability
            may feel small, history shows that collective voices lead to
            real change. Every movement began with individuals refusing to stay
            quiet.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h3>Action Creates Accountability</h3>
          <p>
            When leaders, institutions, and organizations know people are paying
            attention, change becomes unavoidable. Public pressure leads to
            policy changes, funding shifts, and long-term reform.
